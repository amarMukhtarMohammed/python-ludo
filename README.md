This project is a Ludo game implemented in Python, focusing solely on the procedural paradigm as part of my university module.

Below is my initial high-level design plan:

- Choose to start or continue a game
- Add human or computer players (min 2 pl)
- Display players with assigned colours
- Save and quit options
- Display game board
- Random dice roll generator
- Player exits base after the first roll of 6
- Players move around the board
- Players can eliminate others
- Players can reach home
- The game ends when all players are home

I plan to expand on each component in greater detail before implementation, with the goal of finding the most optimal solution.
